# Python  Web-based project

This is the project that I did after finishing an intensive Python course within 2 weeks at VAMK.
The requirements for this project are simple, only CRUD functions for those objects such as Product, Customer and Order are implemented. They come with MySQL database.

I used Flask in this project but if you have found something not good, please don't blame on me because I only learned Python GUI but I implemented a Web-based app using Python.
